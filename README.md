# Evaluation_Gutenberg

This project aims at comparing the topology of two spaces.
One is the ground truth, encoding the genre labelling of texts of a corpora.
The second is the representation of texts, based of features that should be linked with the textual genre.

We compare here, to which extend this ground truth space, and the representations share some topological properties.

Moreover, we try, using the RRelief algorithm, ElasticNet and some Neural Network, to transform the models to make them match better the ground truth space.
